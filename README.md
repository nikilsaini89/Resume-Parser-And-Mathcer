# Resume-Parser-And-Mathcer
 This GitHub repository contains the complete source code and resources used to build a Resume Parser and Matcher Project using NLP.

This is an NLP based Resume Parser and Matcher project. The project was built by me and [Anjali-60](https://github.com/Anjali-60)
 at J.C. Bose University of science and Technology, Faridabad.

Techstack used: NLP, Spacy3, Custom NER, Token_to_vector, Cosine Similarity

Working:

Preprocessing the training data to convert it into suitable format for spacy.
Creating a Docbin object to store data as .spacy file.
Creating .config file and training the custom NER model using spacy.
Taking input Resume and Job profiles as PDF/Doc, and converting them to text.
Parsing the resume and matching it with Job Profile using Cosine Similarity.
The Code_notebook.ipynb contains all the code. On running the code, model will start training. All required files are attached.
